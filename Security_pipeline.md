# üõ°Ô∏è Continuous Security Testing Pipeline

## 1. Problem Statement

Build a DevSecOps-integrated QA pipeline that runs security checks throughout the development lifecycle, detects vulnerabilities early, enforces compliance, and ensures only secure builds are deployed.

---

## 2. Goals & Constraints

* **Shift-left security:** Catch vulnerabilities before production.
* **Fast feedback:** PR checks complete under 5 minutes.
* **Comprehensive coverage:** Include SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, IaC scanning, and secret detection.
* **Policy enforcement:** High/Critical issues block merge or deployment.
* **Compliance alignment:** OWASP Top 10, GDPR, ISO27001.
* **Low developer friction:** Minimize false positives, provide actionable reports.

---

## 3. High-Level Approach

Implement a multi-stage security pipeline integrated with CI/CD:

* Stage 1 (Pull Requests): Fast SAST, secrets scan, dependency scan.
* Stage 2 (Post-merge): Container scan, IaC scan, deploy to staging.
* Stage 3 (Nightly): Full SAST, DAST, automated penetration tests, compliance reports.

Use **policy-as-code** (OPA) to gate builds based on severity.

## 4. Security Layers in the Pipeline

| Layer                 | What it Does                         | Example                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **SAST**              | Scans source code without running it | Flags `eval(user_input)` as insecure    |
| **DAST**              | Tests running app for runtime flaws  | Detects XSS or missing security headers |
| **Dependency Scan**   | Checks libraries for CVEs            | Flags vulnerable `log4j` version        |
| **IaC Scan**          | Reviews Terraform/K8s configs        | Warns if S3 bucket is public            |
| **Secrets Detection** | Finds hardcoded secrets              | Detects `AWS_SECRET_KEY` in code        |
| **Policy-as-Code**    | Automates gating decisions           | Blocks merge if CVSS ‚â• 7.5              |

## 5. High-Level Architecture

```
[Developer Push]
   ‚Üí [Pre-commit Hooks] (Secrets Scan)
   ‚Üí [CI Pipeline]
       Stage 1: SAST + Dependency Scan + Policy Gate
       Stage 2: Build + Container Scan + IaC Scan + Deploy to Staging
[Nightly Jobs]
   ‚Üí Full SAST + DAST + Automated PenTest
   ‚Üí Security Dashboard + Alerts + Jira Tickets
```

---

## 6. Key Components & Tooling

* **SAST:** Semgrep / CodeQL
* **DAST:** OWASP ZAP
* **Dependency Scanning:** Trivy / Snyk
* **IaC Scanning:** Checkov / tfsec
* **Secrets Detection:** detect-secrets, GitHub Secret Scanning
* **Policy Enforcement:** OPA (Open Policy Agent)
* **Reporting:** Central dashboard + PR annotations

---

## 7. Sample CI Workflow (Pseudocode)

```yaml
jobs:
  pr-security-checks:
    steps:
      - run: detect-secrets scan
      - run: semgrep --config=auto
      - run: trivy fs .
      - if: high_severity_found
        run: exit 1   # block PR merge

  post-merge-security:
    steps:
      - run: docker build -t app .
      - run: trivy image app
      - run: checkov -d infrastructure/
      - deploy: staging
```

Nightly:

```yaml
jobs:
  nightly-security:
    steps:
      - run: semgrep --config=full
      - run: zap-full-scan staging.url
      - run: run-automated-pentest staging.url
      - run: upload-reports-to-dashboard
      - run: create-jira-tickets high_severity_findings
```

---

## 8. Complexity & Runtime

* **SAST & Dependency Scan:** O(n) in code size & dependency graph.
* **Pipeline Runtime:** \~3-5 minutes PR-level, longer for nightly.
* **Ops Complexity:** Moderate ‚Äî requires rule tuning & false-positive triage.

---

## 9. Edge Cases & Testing

* False positives ‚Üí Allow risk-based override with audit log.
* Secrets in history ‚Üí Trigger key rotation workflow.
* Pipeline failures ‚Üí Notify security team via Slack/email.
* Regression testing ‚Üí Inject known CVEs to ensure pipeline blocks builds.

---

## 10. Trade-Offs & Alternatives

* **Block-all vs risk-based:** Risk-based chosen to avoid blocking dev flow unnecessarily.
* **Open-source vs commercial tools:** Open-source is cost-effective but needs more tuning.
* **Centralized vs distributed policy:** Centralized for consistency across multiple repos.

---

## 11. Production Considerations

* **Metrics:** MTTR, number of blocked PRs, false-positive ratio.
* **Monitoring:** Security dashboard, Jira/Slack integration.
* **Compliance:** Update scan rules regularly for new CVEs.
* **Key Management:** Automate secret rotation for exposed keys.

---

## 12. MVP ‚Üí Iterative Plan

* **MVP:** PR-level SAST, dependency scan, secrets check, basic OPA gating.
* **Iteration 1:** Container scan, IaC scan, staging deployment.
* **Iteration 2:** Automated DAST, penetration tests, SBOM generation, auto-fix PRs.

## 13. Thought Process

Chose this approach to embed security as early as possible (shift-left) without slowing developers. Focused on open-source tools for transparency and cost savings, with an iterative rollout plan to gradually increase security coverage while minimizing noise.
